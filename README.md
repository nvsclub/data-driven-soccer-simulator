# Data Driven Soccer Simulator

Project from MAMS/SMA ProDEI PhD courses (FEUP).

This project has two parts: the simulator and reinforcement learning.

## Soccer simulator (0XX notebooks). 
We built a soccer simulator using data + machine learning to determine the outcome of certain actions.

# To run the simulator
Video examples:

Interface: https://youtu.be/_GrRzSM7DIY

Notebook: https://youtu.be/vJFMnOiQ8wI


1. Install python (implemented on 3.8.6, should work on 3.8.6+), and dependencies: 
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - tqdm
    - jupyter
2. Run:
    - Script 011b Manual Controller.py to use interface.
    - Notebook 010b Simulation.ipynb to code and test sequencies.

## Reinforcement learning (1XX notebooks).
We've made some experiments to evaluate if we are able to learn new tactics with this approach.
