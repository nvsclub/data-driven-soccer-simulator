# Data Driven Soccer Simulator

Project from MAMS/SMA ProDEI PhD course (FEUP).

This project has two parts: the simulator and reinforcement learning.

## Soccer simulator (0XX notebooks). 
We built a soccer simulator using data + machine learning to determine the outcome of certain actions. Run 011 notebook to play with the simulator

## Reinforcement learning (1XX notebooks).
We've made some experiments to evaluate if we are able to learn new tactics with this approach.
